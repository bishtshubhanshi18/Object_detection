# Object_detection with YOLOv3
This project is an object detection system using YOLOv3 and OpenCV,with an added Text-to-Speech(TTS) feature
that announces the detct objects. it utilizes the COCO dataset to identify common objects in real time.
The project is implemented in python and levarages google text-to-speech (gTTS) and Pygame for audio output.
# Features
Real-time Object Detection using YOLOv3.
Bounding Box Visualization around detected objects.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration, which announces detected objects.
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for better detection accuracy.
